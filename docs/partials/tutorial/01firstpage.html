<p>In this tutorial, we will create a page to display public data using ODS Widgets, looking closely at every step.</p>
<p>We would like to simply show to our users a map of events that occurred recently near them. We found a public dataset from
a crowdsourced list of events (<a href="http://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/evenements-publics-cibul/?tab=metas">you can see it here</a>;
it looks like the perfect source for us. Now, let&#39;s build!</p>
<h3 id="tutorial-a-first-page_contexts">Contexts</h3>
<p>Most widgets are about interacting with data; this means they need to know where to find that data. This is what contexts
are about: a source of data for our widgets. This source can be filtered (especially by other widgets) and shared between widgets, as we will see later.</p>
<p>There are two types of contexts: <a href="#/api/ods-widgets.directive:odsCatalogContext">catalog contexts</a> and <a href="#/api/ods-widgets.directive:odsDatasetContext">dataset contexts</a>.</p>
<p>A <strong>catalog context</strong> represents a catalog of datasets, in other words the list of datasets available on a given portal or API. You can search for datasets in that catalog,
get information about these datasets; but you can&#39;t use this context to interact with the content of these datasets. If you were in a public library, if would be analog to
browsing through the shelves, reading the covers and the back of the books, but not opening them.</p>
<p>A <strong>dataset context</strong> represents a specific dataset, and allows interaction with its content. You can search and filter in the data
using a full range of features (full-text search, geographical search...).</p>
<p><em>Note: Another way to look at it is that catalog contexts are about metadata, and dataset contexts are about data.</em></p>
<p>In our case, we want to display the data from a specific dataset, which is a list of public events: a dataset context is
the right tool for that job. <a href="#/api/ods-widgets.directive:odsDatasetContext">A look at the documentation</a> will give us the syntax and what we need to fill.</p>
<p>First we need to name our context: let&#39;s use &quot;events&quot;.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
&lt;ods-dataset-context context="events"&gt;&lt;/ods-dataset-context&gt;
</pre>
<p>Then we need to provide at least two mandatory attributes: <code>domain</code> and <code>dataset</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>domain</code> attribute represents the location of the dataset: this is usually the domain name of the portal or API where
the dataset is located. In our example, we found it on &quot;public.opendatasoft.com&quot;.</p>
<p>The <code>dataset</code> attribute is the identifier of the dataset we want. You can find it for example indicated as the &quot;Dataset Identifier&quot;
on the <a href="http://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/evenements-publics-cibul/?tab=metas">information page of the dataset</a>.
In our case, it is &quot;evenements-publics-cibul&quot;.</p>
<p>As indicated by the <a href="#/api/ods-widgets.directive:odsDatasetContext">documentation</a>, these attributes are prefixed
by the name of the context (&quot;events&quot;).</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
&lt;ods-dataset-context context="events"
                     events-domain="public.opendatasoft.com"
                     events-dataset="evenements-publics-cibul"&gt;
&lt;/ods-dataset-context&gt;
</pre>
<p>We now have a source of data ready for consumption, but we still lack something to use it.</p>
<h3 id="tutorial-a-first-page_adding-a-widget-to-show-data">Adding a widget to show data</h3>
<p>We saw a <a href="#/api/ods-widgets.directive:odsMap">nice widget (odsMap)</a> that shows data on a map: let&#39;s use it!</p>
<p>When you create a dataset context, it is available to anything inside the HTML element. This means that I need to add
my odsMap widget inside the <code>&lt;ods-dataset-context&gt;</code> element.</p>
<p>As indicated by the <a href="#/api/ods-widgets.directive:odsMap">documentation of the widget</a>, the only mandatory parameter
is <code>context</code>: this is the parameter used to tell which context the widget should get its data from. In our case, the context
is &quot;events&quot;.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
&lt;ods-dataset-context context="events"
                     events-domain="public.opendatasoft.com"
                     events-dataset="evenements-publics-cibul"&gt;
    &lt;ods-map context="events"&gt;&lt;/ods-map&gt;
&lt;/ods-dataset-context&gt;
</pre>

<h3 id="tutorial-a-first-page_adding-another-widget-to-filter-the-data">Adding another widget to filter the data</h3>
<p>We would like to allow users to see what happened recently: last week, last month...</p>
<p>Luckily for us, there is a widget that does exactly that: <a href="#/api/ods-widgets.directive:odsTimescale">the odsTimescale widget</a>.</p>
<p>This widget allows users to select a range in the past to filter the data. According to the documentation, the only parameter it requires
is a context, but we can also target a specific date field. Here, we&#39;d like to show the events that ended recently, so let&#39;s use the
<code>date_end</code> field that contains exactly what we need.</p>
<p>We want it to filter the data displayed by the map, so all we need is to plug it to the same context.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
&lt;ods-dataset-context context="events"
                     events-domain="public.opendatasoft.com"
                     events-dataset="evenements-publics-cibul"&gt;
    &lt;ods-timescale context="events" time-field="date_end"&gt;&lt;/ods-timescale&gt;
    &lt;ods-map context="events"&gt;&lt;/ods-map&gt;
&lt;/ods-dataset-context&gt;
