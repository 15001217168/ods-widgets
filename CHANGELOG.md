# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This log tries to follow the good principles of [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/).

## Unreleased (as 0.1.1-dev)
### Added
- We now have a changelog!
- New widget: `odsTimerange`. This widget displays a calendar to select a range
of date or datetime to refine on.
- `odsGeotooltip` can now be directly passed a record to display its geographical
information, instead of having to explicitely pass the field name.
- `odsMap` now supports a new mechanism to refine another context when the user
clicks on a marker or shape. See the `itemClickContext` in the documentation.
- `odsResultEnumerator` now support a `showHitsCounter` parameter to display
a simple counter of the number of hits.
