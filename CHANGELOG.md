# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This log tries to follow the good principles of [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/).

## 1.0.0 - 2015-12-14
This release is the one that finally jumps to the 1.x.x major version number! Many changes in the structure and styles, most of
them being breaking changes, so it warranted a major version; and at the same time we are now confident that it is going
to stay stable for a long time, so the jump to 1.x seemed warranted. 

There are two (big) breaking changes:
- **Internet Explorer 8 is no longer supported.** This seems harsh, but this enabled us to upgrade Angular version to 1.4,
and allowed a lot of improvements under the hood. In other words, everything is a bit better and faster, at the expense
of IE8.
- **Every CSS class name and widget style have changed.** Previously, styles and classes were done without much consistency,
and it made it harder to override the style of some widgets. Everything has been rewritten to be easier to alter the style
of every widget to match the style of your own website, without having to use 8-levels-deep-nested styles (or even worse, `!important`).
But unfortunately, this means that any current customization is likely to be entirely broken.

### Added
- New `odsInfiniteScrollResults` widget
- New `odsPlumeAirQuality`: displays the status of the air quality in a specific city
- New `odsClearAllFilters`: a simple link to reset all filters on a context.
- New `odsDatetime`: can be used to inject the current date/time as a variable in the page.
- New `odsRedirectIfNotLoggedIn` (OpenDataSoft customers): redirects the users to the login page if they are not logged in.
Can be used on a public page that uses private datasets, to ensure the user doesn't stop at an empty dashboard. Only works
on the OpenDataSoft platform.
- New `availableCalendarViews` parameter on `odsCalendar`, allowing you to restrict the available views in the calendar.
- New `minZoom` and `maxZoom` parameters on `odsMap`, to restrict the available zoom levels.
- New `scrollWheelZoom` parameter on `odsMap` to prevent the mousewheel to zoom/unzoom. Can be useful on a scrollable
page with a large map, to avoid frustrating behavior where you want to scroll the page but your mousewheel gets stopped
by a map right in the middle.
- `odsTwitterTimeline` now supports `width` and `height` parameters to configure the dimensions of the widget.

### Fixed
- When using two or more layers with the `showIf` parameter, sometimes the map wouldn't detect the changes and wouldn't
refresh. This is now fixed. There can still be issues if these layers are using the same context, which will be fixed
in the close future.

## 0.1.8 - 2015-09-01
### Added
- New `odsCalendar` widget! Displays a calendar view of your data. Live example: http://data.issy.com/explore/dataset/agendav2/?tab=calendar
- In `odsDatasetContext`, you can now set `mycontextname-urlsync="true"` to synchronize this context's parameter with
the page's URL, so that the URL changes when the parameters change. Also, if you arrive on the page with parameters in
the URL, the context will directly initialize with these parameters. You can use this to make dynamic pages with URL 
parameters (for examples mypage?refine.city=Paris).
- In `odsReuses`, you can now pass a template to configure how to display each reuse. More information is available
in the widget's documentation.
- In `odsfilterSummary`, there is now an option to not display the "clear all" button below the active filters.
- In `odsTagCloud`, you can now use the widget as a way to refine your context. See the widget's documentation for more
information.

### Fixed
- In `odsThemeBoxes`, fixed a bug where the boxes would not appear at all. Also fixed an alignment bug with Internet
Explorer.
- In `odsLastDatasetsFeed` and `odsMostPopularDatasets`, fixed a bug where the theme picto would not be displayed if
the dataset had more than one theme.
- In `odsMap`, the border color and opacity options now apply to every visualization mode that displays shapes (previously
only appeared on the "aggregation" visualization mode).


## 0.1.7 - 2015-05-29
### Added
- New `odsFacetResults` widget, which can be used to iterate the values of a facet and build HTML from it (simple list, select, radio buttons...).
- In `odsChart`, you can now trigger a refine on a context from a click on a bar chart or pie chart using a new `refineOnClickContext` parameter.
- In `odsChart` you can configure the unit (Â°C, ...) of displayed values using a new `displayUnits`
- In `odsMap` you can configure the border color and opacity of shapes using new `borderColor` and `opacity` parameters on the `odsMapLayer` tag.
- In `odsMap`, if a field contains only a link to a Youtube, Vimeo or Dailymotion video, the video player is directly embedded in the tooltip.

### Removed
- The `odsFacetEnumerator` is gone (for now), replaced by the slightly lower-level `odsFacetResults` which can be used in more cases.

### Fixed
- Various fixes for glitches in label display in `odsChart`
- When an `odsMap` is configured as "static", the user is no longer able to navigate using the keyboard.


## 0.1.6 - 2015-03-27
### Added
- All templates are now inlined instead of external; this means that you won't have any more issue with CORS and widgets such as `odsTable` and `odsMap`. 
Also, all examples in the documentation should now work, and testing in Plunkr should be easier!
- When using `odsFacets` with the searchbox, the current search is now reset when you select a category.
- You can now prevent specific parameters to be displayed within `odsFilterSummary`.
- You can now use a function on `odsDatasetContext` objects to get a link that can be used to download the current data, based on active filters.

### Fixed
- Fixed a problem where the `odsTimescale` widget may crash if initialized directly upon context initialization.
- Fixed a problem where `odsFacets`, `odsDomainStatistics`, `odsFilterSummary` and `odsTagCloud` wouldn't work
with the minified version of ods-widgets.
- All the directives templates are now defined inside the directives code: this ensures that there is no request needed
to fetch the templates, which caused CORS issues for developers with no ability to enable CORS on their server (e.g. no access
to the configuration), and issues on the documentation.
- Fixed potential race conditions in `odsChart` and `odsTable` when filters where changed too quickly.
- Fixed layout issues when an `odsMap` was contained inside an `odsDatasetCard`.
- You can now use `odsTimescale`, `odsTimerange`, and/or `odsTextSearch` without each one overriding the other.
- Limiting the size of the real text content within `odsTable` cells, to prevent browsers crashes.
- Fixed some map pictos from not being displayed under Firefox 36, due to a browser bug.
- Fixed some cases where a reverse sort on Y axis in `odsChart` would be ignored. 
- Various IE8 fixes.


## 0.1.5 - 2015-02-20
### Added
- The `odsMap` has been modified to be much more powerful and support multiple layers, visualization modes, and contexts.
It can be used to build interactive maps from various dynamic data sources. More information is available in the documentation,
and two new tutorial pages are dedicated to it. Note: if you have issue with your existing `<ods-map>` usage, especially
if you are using advanced options like aggregation colors, you can use `<ods-map-legacy>` instead which is the former tag
under another name.
- The `odsTimerange` widget now supports specific dates to be passed as default values, instead of just "yesterday" and
"now".
- The `odsFacets` widget now supports parameters to enable disjunctive refinement, and a searchbox within the values. See the documentation
for more information.
- New `odsAggregation` widget to expose the result of an aggregation function on a dataset into a variable.
- New `odsFilterSummary` to display a view of the filters that are currently active on a context.

### Fixed
- In `odsMap`, some pictos may have been aligned to the left instead of properly centered; this should no longer happen.
- The `odsHighcharts` widget now properly uses API keys configured in its context.
- The `odsSearchbox` widget's placeholder is now properly translated.


## 0.1.4 - 2015-01-28
### Added
- New `odsPaginationBlock` widget, especially used in `odsResultEnumerator` where you can use a new `showPagination` attribute
to display a pagination control below your results.
- `odsFacets` now support the configuration of a specific order for facet values. It can be used for example to ensure
 "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday"... are displayed in the right order. 
 See documentation of the `sort` parameter for more information.
- In `odsMap` default tooltips, if a field contains a link to a YouTube video, a mini video player is displayed.
- Clicking on a reuse's source will now open in a new tab by default.
- When `odsTextSearch` initialized, it now takes the `q=` parameter of its context as a default value.

### Fixed
- The `imagify` filter no longer cuts URL parameters from detected image links; this means you'll no longer see this problem
in `odsMap` tooltips for example.
- Linebreaks between start and end of the `odsTable` tag no longer triggers an empty custom template for cells.
- Clicking on a reuse (from `odsReuses` or `odsLastReusesFeed`) will bring you to the dataset's information tab where all
the reuses are listed, instead of a default visualization.
- `odsSearchBox` now works in every case; previously, depending on how it was initialized, it may have been not working when submitting a search.


## 0.1.3 - 2014-12-04
### Added
- New widget: `odsToggleModel`. It can be used on a checkbox, to add/remove a parameter depending on the state of the checkbox.
- It is now possible to customize the template of reuses in the `odsLastReusesFeed` widget. See the widget's documentation for more information.
- `odsLastReusesFeed` now has a `max` parameter to set a maximum number of reuses to display.
- `odsMap` custom tooltips have been simplified and do not require including some code for scrolling between multiple records anymore. Documentation is coming soon!
- `odsResults` widget, when used with an `odsCatalogContext`, now retrieves every metadata, including DCAT and others, so that you can use them in results display.
- Facet values are now also displayed as a tooltip on mouse hover (title), making it possible to read long values that have been truncated.

### Fixed
- The sort icons on the `odsTable` widget now show the proper direction, and sorting on an alphanumeric field now sorts
in the right direction the first time.
- `odsMap` now handles massive amounts of data much faster than before.


## 0.1.2 - 2014-10-15
### Added
- New widget: `odsFacets`. This widget allows you to insert and finely configure filters for your data, including customizing the way each available
value is displayed. You can find more information in the documentation.
- New widget: `odsReuses`. This widget displays an infinite list of reuses for a domain, displayed in large boxes.
- The user's timezones is now taken into account in filters and facets.

### Fixed
- Internet Explorer 8 and 9 can now interact with non-local APIs: the widgets now use JSONP to circumvent these browsers'
limitations with cross-domain requests.


## 0.1.1 - 2014-09-17
### Added
- We now have a changelog!
- New widget: `odsTimerange`. This widget displays a calendar to select a range
of date or datetime to refine on.
- New widget: `odsResults`. This widget exposes the result of a search query as a variable in your scope. It can be
easily combined with AngularJS's ngRepeat to display a custom list of results.
- `odsGeotooltip` can now be directly passed a record to display its geographical
information, instead of having to explicitely pass the field name.
- `odsMap` now supports a new mechanism to refine another context when the user
clicks on a marker or shape. See the `itemClickContext` in the documentation.
- `odsResultEnumerator` now support a `showHitsCounter` parameter to display
a simple counter of the number of hits.
- If there is no data to display, the `odsHighcharts` widget now displays an
explicit message instead of an empty space.
- The HTTP requests sent to APIs now include an `ODS-Widgets-Version` header to indicate
the version of the ODS-Widgets library.
- To improve support for Internet Explorer 8, you can now load a `ieshiv.js` file (or its minified version also included)
before AngularJS is loaded in your page.

### Removed
- `odsTable` no longer has a `tableContext` parameter; instead, the active sort is
now directly shared in the context itself, like the other parameters.

### Fixed
- On Internet Explorer 8, Vector markers (typically containing a pictogram) were sometimes subject to
bad positioning and appeared far from their original location.
